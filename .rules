## Rust Coding Guidelines

* Prioritize code correctness and clarity. Speed and efficiency are secondary priorities unless otherwise specified.
* Do not write organizational or comments that summarize the code. Comments should only be written in order to explain "why" the code is written in some way in the case there is a reason that is tricky / non-obvious.
* Prefer implementing functionality in existing files unless it is a new logical component. Avoid creating many small files.
* Avoid using functions that panic like `unwrap()`, instead use mechanisms like `?` to propagate errors.
* Be careful with operations like indexing which may panic if the indexes are out of bounds.
* Never silently discard errors with `let _ =` on fallible operations. Always handle errors appropriately:
  - Propagate errors with `?` when the calling function should handle them
  - Use `.log_err()` or similar when you need to ignore errors but want visibility
  - Use explicit error handling with `match` or `if let Err(...)` when you need custom logic
  - Example: avoid `let _ = client.request(...).await?;` - use `client.request(...).await?;` instead
* When implementing async operations that may fail, ensure errors propagate to the UI layer so users get meaningful feedback.
* Never create files with `mod.rs` paths - prefer `src/some_module.rs` instead of `src/some_module/mod.rs`.
* When creating new crates, prefer specifying the library root path in `Cargo.toml` using `[lib] path = "...rs"` instead of the default `lib.rs`, to maintain consistent and descriptive naming (e.g., `gpui.rs` or `main.rs`).
* Avoid creative additions unless explicitly requested
* Use full words for variable names (no abbreviations like "q" for "queue")
* Use variable shadowing to scope clones in async contexts for clarity, minimizing the lifetime of borrowed references.
  Example:
  ```rust
  executor.spawn({
      let task_ran = task_ran.clone();
      async move {
          *task_ran.borrow_mut() = true;
      }
  });
  ```

# Timers in tests

* In GPUI tests, prefer GPUI executor timers over `smol::Timer::after(...)` when you need timeouts, delays, or to drive `run_until_parked()`:
  - Use `cx.background_executor().timer(duration).await` (or `cx.background_executor.timer(duration).await` in `TestAppContext`) so the work is scheduled on GPUI's dispatcher.
  - Avoid `smol::Timer::after(...)` for test timeouts when you rely on `run_until_parked()`, because it may not be tracked by GPUI's scheduler and can lead to "nothing left to run" when pumping.

# GPUI

GPUI is a UI framework which also provides primitives for state and concurrency management.

## Context

Context types allow interaction with global state, windows, entities, and system services. They are typically passed to functions as the argument named `cx`. When a function takes callbacks they come after the `cx` parameter.

* `App` is the root context type, providing access to global state and read and update of entities.
* `Context<T>` is provided when updating an `Entity<T>`. This context dereferences into `App`, so functions which take `&App` can also take `&Context<T>`.
* `AsyncApp` and `AsyncWindowContext` are provided by `cx.spawn` and `cx.spawn_in`. These can be held across await points.

## `Window`

`Window` provides access to the state of an application window. It is passed to functions as an argument named `window` and comes before `cx` when present. It is used for managing focus, dispatching actions, directly drawing, getting user input state, etc.

## Entities

An `Entity<T>` is a handle to state of type `T`. With `thing: Entity<T>`:

* `thing.entity_id()` returns `EntityId`
* `thing.downgrade()` returns `WeakEntity<T>`
* `thing.read(cx: &App)` returns `&T`.
* `thing.read_with(cx, |thing: &T, cx: &App| ...)` returns the closure's return value.
* `thing.update(cx, |thing: &mut T, cx: &mut Context<T>| ...)` allows the closure to mutate the state, and provides a `Context<T>` for interacting with the entity. It returns the closure's return value.
* `thing.update_in(cx, |thing: &mut T, window: &mut Window, cx: &mut Context<T>| ...)` takes a `AsyncWindowContext` or `VisualTestContext`. It's the same as `update` while also providing the `Window`.

Within the closures, the inner `cx` provided to the closure must be used instead of the outer `cx` to avoid issues with multiple borrows.

Trying to update an entity while it's already being updated must be avoided as this will cause a panic.

When  `read_with`, `update`, or `update_in` are used with an async context, the closure's return value is wrapped in an `anyhow::Result`.

`WeakEntity<T>` is a weak handle. It has `read_with`, `update`, and `update_in` methods that work the same, but always return an `anyhow::Result` so that they can fail if the entity no longer exists. This can be useful to avoid memory leaks - if entities have mutually recursive handles to each other they will never be dropped.

## Concurrency

All use of entities and UI rendering occurs on a single foreground thread.

`cx.spawn(async move |cx| ...)` runs an async closure on the foreground thread. Within the closure, `cx` is `&mut AsyncApp`.

When the outer cx is a `Context<T>`, the use of `spawn` instead looks like `cx.spawn(async move |this, cx| ...)`, where `this: WeakEntity<T>` and `cx: &mut AsyncApp`.

To do work on other threads, `cx.background_spawn(async move { ... })` is used. Often this background task is awaited on by a foreground task which uses the results to update state.

Both `cx.spawn` and `cx.background_spawn` return a `Task<R>`, which is a future that can be awaited upon. If this task is dropped, then its work is cancelled. To prevent this one of the following must be done:

* Awaiting the task in some other async context.
* Detaching the task via `task.detach()` or `task.detach_and_log_err(cx)`, allowing it to run indefinitely.
* Storing the task in a field, if the work should be halted when the struct is dropped.

A task which doesn't do anything but provide a value can be created with `Task::ready(value)`.

## Elements

The `Render` trait is used to render some state into an element tree that is laid out using flexbox layout. An `Entity<T>` where `T` implements `Render` is sometimes called a "view".

Example:

```
struct TextWithBorder(SharedString);

impl Render for TextWithBorder {
    fn render(&mut self, _window: &mut Window, _cx: &mut Context<Self>) -> impl IntoElement {
        div().border_1().child(self.0.clone())
    }
}
```

Since `impl IntoElement for SharedString` exists, it can be used as an argument to `child`. `SharedString` is used to avoid copying strings, and is either an `&'static str` or `Arc<str>`.

UI components that are constructed just to be turned into elements can instead implement the `RenderOnce` trait, which is similar to `Render`, but its `render` method takes ownership of `self` and receives `&mut App` instead of `&mut Context<Self>`. Types that implement this trait can use `#[derive(IntoElement)]` to use them directly as children.

The style methods on elements are similar to those used by Tailwind CSS.

If some attributes or children of an element tree are conditional, `.when(condition, |this| ...)` can be used to run the closure only when `condition` is true. Similarly, `.when_some(option, |this, value| ...)` runs the closure when the `Option` has a value.

## Input events

Input event handlers can be registered on an element via methods like `.on_click(|event, window, cx: &mut App| ...)`.

Often event handlers will want to update the entity that's in the current `Context<T>`. The `cx.listener` method provides this - its use looks like `.on_click(cx.listener(|this: &mut T, event, window, cx: &mut Context<T>| ...)`.

## Drag and Drop

### Classic Pitfall: `on_drag_move` fires for ALL registered handlers

`on_drag_move` events fire during the Capture phase, which means ALL elements with registered `on_drag_move` handlers will receive the event, regardless of where the mouse actually is. This can cause unexpected behavior where a "background" or "blank-area" handler overwrites the target set by specific item handlers.

**Wrong:**
```rust
// Background area - this handler fires even when mouse is over list items!
div()
    .id("blank-area")
    .on_drag_move::<DraggedItem>(cx.listener(
        |this, _event, _window, cx| {
            this.drag_target = Some(DragTarget::Root);  // Overwrites item targets!
            cx.notify();
        },
    ))
```

**Correct:**
```rust
// Background area - check bounds before setting target
div()
    .id("blank-area")
    .on_drag_move::<DraggedItem>(cx.listener(
        |this, event: &DragMoveEvent<DraggedItem>, _window, cx| {
            if event.bounds.contains(&event.event.position) {
                this.drag_target = Some(DragTarget::Root);
                cx.notify();
            }
        },
    ))
```

Always use `event.bounds.contains(&event.event.position)` in `on_drag_move` handlers to ensure the mouse is actually within the element's bounds. See `project_panel` for reference implementation.

## Actions

Actions are dispatched via user keyboard interaction or in code via `window.dispatch_action(SomeAction.boxed_clone(), cx)` or `focus_handle.dispatch_action(&SomeAction, window, cx)`.

Actions with no data defined with the `actions!(some_namespace, [SomeAction, AnotherAction])` macro call. Otherwise the `Action` derive macro is used. Doc comments on actions are displayed to the user.

Action handlers can be registered on an element via the event handler `.on_action(|action, window, cx| ...)`. Like other event handlers, this is often used with `cx.listener`.

## Notify

When a view's state has changed in a way that may affect its rendering, it should call `cx.notify()`. This will cause the view to be rerendered. It will also cause any observe callbacks registered for the entity with `cx.observe` to be called.

## Entity events

While updating an entity (`cx: Context<T>`), it can emit an event using `cx.emit(event)`. Entities register which events they can emit by declaring `impl EventEmitter<EventType> for EntityType {}`.

Other entities can then register a callback to handle these events by doing `cx.subscribe(other_entity, |this, other_entity, event, cx| ...)`. This will return a `Subscription` which deregisters the callback when dropped.  Typically `cx.subscribe` happens when creating a new entity and the subscriptions are stored in a `_subscriptions: Vec<Subscription>` field.

## Build guidelines

- Use `./script/clippy` instead of `cargo clippy`

## Session Management

The terminal crate includes a session management system for persistent SSH/Telnet configurations (`crates/terminal/src/session_store.rs`).

### Data Model

- `SessionNode`: Enum representing either a `Group` or `Session` in a tree structure
- `SessionGroup`: Folder containing other groups or sessions
- `SessionConfig`: Session configuration with name, tags, and protocol-specific settings
- `ProtocolConfig`: Enum for `Ssh` or `Telnet` configurations
- `AuthMethod`: Authentication options (Interactive, Password, PrivateKey, Agent)

### GPUI Integration

- `SessionStoreEntity`: GPUI entity wrapping `SessionStore` with auto-save and event emission
- `GlobalSessionStore`: Global marker for `cx.global()` access
- `SessionStoreEvent`: Events for UI subscription (Changed, SessionAdded, SessionRemoved)

### Usage

```rust
// Initialize on app startup
SessionStoreEntity::init(cx);

// Access globally
let sessions = SessionStoreEntity::global(cx);
sessions.update(cx, |store, cx| {
    store.add_session(config, parent_id, cx);
});

// Subscribe to changes
cx.subscribe(&sessions, |this, _, event, cx| {
    // Handle SessionStoreEvent
});
```

### Persistence

Sessions are stored in `~/.config/zed/sessions.json` (or platform equivalent via `paths::sessions_file()`).

## Telnet Connection

The terminal crate includes a Telnet connection module (`crates/terminal/src/connection/telnet/`) for connecting to remote hosts via the Telnet protocol.

### Module Structure

```
telnet/
  mod.rs          # TelnetConfig, exports
  protocol.rs     # Telnet IAC handling, option negotiation
  session.rs      # TelnetSession - TCP connection management
  terminal.rs     # TelnetTerminalConnection - implements TerminalConnection trait
```

### Protocol Implementation (`protocol.rs`)

- **IAC Commands**: IAC (255), DO (253), DONT (254), WILL (251), WONT (252), SB (250), SE (240)
- **Option Codes**: ECHO (1), SUPPRESS_GO_AHEAD (3), TERMINAL_TYPE (24), NAWS (31)
- `TelnetNegotiator`: Parses IAC sequences and generates appropriate responses
- `process_incoming()`: Separates terminal data from commands, returns protocol responses
- `build_naws()`: Generates window size subnegotiation packet (RFC 1073)
- IAC escaping: 255 255 → single 255

### TelnetConfig (`mod.rs`)

```rust
pub struct TelnetConfig {
    pub host: String,
    pub port: u16,
    pub username: Option<String>,
    pub password: Option<String>,
    pub encoding: Option<String>,
    pub terminal_type: String,  // default: "xterm-256color"
}
```

### TelnetSession (`session.rs`)

Manages TCP connection lifecycle:
- `connect()`: Establishes TCP connection, returns read/write halves for the channel task

### TelnetTerminalConnection (`terminal.rs`)

Implements `TerminalConnection` trait (same interface as SSH):
- Uses `TelnetChannelCommand` enum (Write, Resize, Close)
- Channel task with `futures::select_biased!` for concurrent I/O
- Automatic NAWS window size updates after negotiation

### Usage

```rust
// Create terminal with Telnet connection
let terminal = TerminalBuilder::new_with_telnet(
    telnet_config,
    cursor_shape,
    alternate_scroll,
    max_scroll_history_lines,
    window_id,
    cx,
    path_style,
).await?;

// Or connect via quick_add helper
connect_telnet(telnet_config, workspace, pane, window, cx);
```

### Converting from SessionStore config

```rust
use terminal::connection::telnet::TelnetConfig;

let telnet_session_config: TelnetSessionConfig = /* from session store */;
let config: TelnetConfig = (&telnet_session_config).into();
```

## Remote Explorer Panel

The `remote_explorer` crate (`crates/remote_explorer`) provides a panel for browsing saved SSH/Telnet sessions in a tree view.

### Architecture

- Uses `UniformList` for virtual scrolling with flattened tree structure
- Indentation via `ListItem.indent_level()` with `px(12.)` step size
- Icons: `FolderOpen`/`Folder` for groups, `Server` for sessions
- Subscribes to `SessionStoreEvent` for automatic updates

### Key Components

- `FlattenedEntry`: Flattened tree entry with `id`, `depth`, and `node`
- `RemoteExplorer`: Main panel struct implementing `Panel`, `Focusable`, `Render`
- `init(cx)`: Initializes `SessionStoreEntity` and registers `ToggleFocus` action
- `load()`: Async loader for workspace panel initialization

### Integration Points

- **Action**: `zed_actions::remote_explorer::ToggleFocus`
- **Menu**: View > Remote Explorer
- **Icon**: Server icon in left dock
- **Position**: Left or Right dock (default: Left)
- **Priority**: `activation_priority = 10`

### Usage

```rust
// In app initialization (already done in zed crate)
remote_explorer::init(cx);

// Panel is automatically loaded via initialize_workspace()
let remote_explorer = RemoteExplorer::load(workspace_handle.clone(), cx.clone());
```

## Editor Panel

The `editor_panel` crate (`crates/editor_panel`) provides a dockable panel for code editing, similar to the main editor but positioned in a dock.

### Architecture

- Wraps a `Pane` containing editor items
- Auto-closes when the last tab is closed (matches TerminalPanel behavior)
- Supports tab bar display and pane splitting

### Key Components

- `EditorPanel`: Main panel struct implementing `Panel`, `Focusable`, `Render`
- `new_editor_pane()`: Creates a configured pane for the editor panel
- `init(cx)`: Registers `ToggleFocus` action

### Integration Points

- **Action**: `zed_actions::editor_panel::ToggleFocus`
- **Position**: Left, Right, or Bottom dock (default: Right)
- **Auto-close**: Panel closes automatically when last tab is closed
